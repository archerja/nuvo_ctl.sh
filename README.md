nuvo_ctl.sh
=======

Latest version = 0.1.0

This shell script will control a Nuvo Essentia whole house audio system.
It will also use MPC (MPD client) to control MPD jukebox running on a server.

**History**

My wife and I built a house in 2005. I ran speakers in the ceiling of every room and installed a Nuvo Essentia unit to control it all.

Life was good. There was a small controller, on the wall, of every room. You could select up to 6 different audio sources (TV, radio, MPD, CD, etc.).

The Nuvo Essentia head unit could be controlled from a rs232 (serial cable), and I had the MPD jukebox right next to it, so I connected a cable and created this script.

It could remotely turn on, turn off, increase volume, decrease volume, all on, all off,... (you get the idea...)


**PROJECT INACTIVE**

After nine years, we sold the house, and moved on. I do not have access to a Nuvo system anymore, so this project is essentially dead.

I placed the script here, so that maybe someone will find it useful.
